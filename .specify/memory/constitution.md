# Tanzeem-e-Khawajgan Organization Website Constitution

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to design and develop a professional, modern, and AI-enabled organization website that serves as the official digital presence of Tanzeem-e-Khawajgan.

The website will:
- Communicate the organization's vision, mission, and services
- Provide transparent governance and public information
- Enable structured navigation across all departments
- Integrate an Agentic AI system for guided assistance and actions
- Be scalable, maintainable, and specification-driven

This project is not a static website; it is an AI-assisted, rule-governed software system.

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy
All content must reflect verified and approved organizational information. No assumptions, placeholders, or unverified data may be published.

### II. Clarity
Content and UI must be understandable to a general public audience. Technical jargon should be avoided in user-facing content.

### III. Consistency
Design, navigation, and behavior must remain uniform across all pages. Pattern deviations require explicit specification.

### IV. Maintainability
The system must be modular and spec-driven for future growth. Hard-coded values, navigation, or content violate this principle.

### V. AI Governance
AI behavior must be controlled, explainable, and bounded by rules. The AI system is an Agentic AI, not a generic chatbot, with defined sub-agents and clear permissions.

### VI. Specification-Driven Development
All features must follow the workflow: Constitution → Specification → Plan → Tasks → Implementation. No feature may be implemented without an approved specification.

## Agentic AI System Constitution

### Architecture
The AI system must be implemented as an **Agentic AI**, not a generic chatbot.

**Main Agent (Controller):**
- Routes requests to appropriate sub-agents
- Maintains conversation context
- Enforces governance rules

**Sub-Agents:**
1. **Information Agent**: Answers questions based on website content
2. **Navigation Agent**: Guides users through navigation
3. **Services Agent**: Handles service-specific queries
4. **Policy Agent**: Ensures compliance with governance rules
5. **Action Agent**: Performs approved actions (forms, inquiries)

### AI Capabilities
**The AI Agent Must:**
- Answer questions based on website content only
- Guide users through navigation
- Perform approved actions (forms, inquiries)
- Reject unapproved requests with clear explanation
- Use professional and neutral language
- Rely only on verified content
- State clearly when information is unavailable

**The AI Agent Must Not:**
- Provide personal opinions
- Give legal, medical, or financial advice
- Act outside defined permissions
- Make assumptions or hallucinations
- Store conversations persistently
- Access unauthorized data

### AI Behavior Standards
**Language & Tone:**
- Professional and neutral
- Clear and concise
- Culturally appropriate
- Empathetic but bounded

**Error Handling:**
- Clear fallback messages
- Graceful degradation
- Error logging (no user data)

**Permissions:**
- Read-only access to website content
- Form submission (with validation)
- Navigation assistance
- No data modification
- No external API calls without approval

## Development Workflow

### Specification-Driven Process
1. **Constitution**: Establish project principles (this document)
2. **Specification**: Define feature requirements (`specs/<feature>/spec.md`)
3. **Plan**: Create architecture and design (`specs/<feature>/plan.md`)
4. **Tasks**: Break down into testable tasks (`specs/<feature>/tasks.md`)
5. **Implementation**: Execute with tests
6. **Documentation**: Create PHRs and ADRs

### Prompt History Records (PHR)
**Routing (all under `history/prompts/`):**
- Constitution → `history/prompts/constitution/`
- Feature-specific → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/`
- General → `history/prompts/general/`

**PHR Creation Required For:**
- Implementation work (code changes, new features)
- Planning/architecture discussions
- Debugging sessions
- Spec/task/plan creation
- Multi-step workflows

### Architecture Decision Records (ADR)
**ADR Significance Test:**
- **Impact**: Long-term consequences? (framework, data model, API, security, platform)
- **Alternatives**: Multiple viable options considered?
- **Scope**: Cross-cutting and influences system design?

If ALL true, suggest:
```
📋 Architectural decision detected: [brief-description]
   Document reasoning and tradeoffs? Run `/sp.adr [decision-title]`
```

**ADR Guidelines:**
- Wait for consent; never auto-create ADRs
- Group related decisions into one ADR when appropriate
- Store in `history/adr/`
